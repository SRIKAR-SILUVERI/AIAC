# For the function f(x) = 2x^3 + 4x + 5, find the value of x where f(x) is minimum.
# Since this is a cubic function (degree 3), the minimum (if any) might be at critical points or at infinity.
# Let's compute the derivative and solve for f'(x) = 0

def f(x):

def f_prime(x):

# Set derivative to 0: 6x^2 + 4 = 0 => x^2 = -4/6 = -2/3
# This equation has no real solution (x^2 cannot be negative).
# Therefore, f'(x) does not vanish for any real x, and since the coefficient of x^3 is positive,
# the function decreases without bound as x → -∞ and increases without bound as x → +∞.
# So the function does not have a global minimum on the real numbers.
# But we can check its behavior.
